Code Competition:
SuperteamUK is always on the lookout for talented developers who can push the boundaries of what's possible on the Solana blockchain. At Chain Reaction today, we're challenging you to showcase your coding prowess with an exciting project: Building a "Wall of Wish" on the Solana blockchain.

Your task is to create a decentralized application where users can record their wishes on-chain. This challenge is not only about coding but also about understanding the intricacies of blockchain technology and how to make it accessible and meaningful.

ðŸŽ¯ Your Mission: Develop a "Wall of Wish" on the Solana blockchain. The application should allow users to submit their wishes, which are then stored on-chain. This task requires proficiency in Anchor and an understanding of Program Derived Addresses (PDAs). Your code should include an instruction for 'wish' and a PDA defined as 'AWish {title: String}'.

Everyone who successfully completes the challenge will earn $50 and be invited to our Solana UK Engineer group to gain recognition within the SuperteamUK community and be featured in our monthly newsletter.

Evaluation Criteria:

Functionality: Does the application work as intended?

Creativity: How innovative is your approach?

Technical proficiency: Are Anchor & PDA effectively utilized?

User experience: Is the application easy to use and intuitive?
